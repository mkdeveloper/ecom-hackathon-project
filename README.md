## HACKATHONE ONE

In this Project you will learn how to implement Redux, api implementation, how to use vercel's postgress Database via Drizzle ORM, stripe integration and how to delete an order if the stripe checkout completes.

For Each step Implementation, a new branch will be created, and it's link will be provided here.

**I have used**

- Next.js 13.4 (app router)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Sanity for content management
- React Redux for state management
- Vercel Postgres for cart data management
- Drizzle ORM for database
- Stripe for payment
- Webhooks (which will handle the calls coming from stripe)
